Compatibility
===

As far as I know it runs on Mac OS X 10.4, 10.5 and 10.6.

Can the game be won?
===

Yes :)

Is it open source?
===

The wrapper I wrote is public domain. DOSBox (included) is open source. The code for the original game has been lost.

Did you write Conflict?
===

No, I just package it for Mac OS X. David Eastman and Shahid Ahmad created conflict.

Are you distributing pirated software?
===

No. I have permission from David Eastman, the current copyright holder, to distribute Conflict within Conflict For Mac.
