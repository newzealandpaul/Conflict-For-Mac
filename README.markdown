Download
===

The game can be downloaded [here](http://github.com/paulwilliam/Conflict-For-Mac/downloads).

Compatibility
===

As far as I know it runs on Mac OS X 10.4, 10.5 and 10.6.

Can the game be won?
===

Yes :)

Is it open source?
===

The wrapper I wrote is public domain. [DOSBox](http://www.dosbox.com/) (included) is open source. The code for the original game has been lost.

Did you write Conflict?
===

No, I just package it for Mac OS X. [David Eastman](http://www.eastman.me.uk/) and Shahid Ahmad created conflict.

Are you distributing pirated software?
===

No. I have permission from David Eastman, the current copyright holder, to distribute Conflict within Conflict For Mac.

This looks like Israeli / Syrian / Lebanese / Iranian / [Insert Country Here] propaganda?
===

Conflict is game, nothing more. It was first published over 20 years ago. Any similarity to recent events is coincidental.
